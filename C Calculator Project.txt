C Calculator Project

A simple command-line **Calculator** program written in **C**.  
This project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, operators, and input validation in C programming.

Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`) → with protection against division by zero
- Modulus (`%`) → works with integers (floats are cast to integers before modulus)
